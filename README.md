Skeleton for JavaScript Coding Dojo

## TDD and Pair Programming

You should work in pairs:
1) person A writes a test that fails
2) person B implements the most basic code that makes the test green
3) pair refactors the code to make it clean
4) person B writes a test that fails
5) person A implements the most basic code that makes the test green
6) pair refactors the code to make it clean
7) goto 1.

## Baby Steps

The next test you write should be the most basic case that breaks the code. The way you modify the code should be the most simple solution that fixes the test. Refactoring should happen when the tests are green. You should end up with clean code.

## "Do not talk"

You should talk using the code, and discuss your ideas by writing a change.

## The Path Is the Goal

Finishing the task is not a goal, but learning TDD, pair programming and the baby steps concept.
